# Adding a Restart Button to the Number Incrementer Application

To add a restart button to the Number Incrementer application, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the `main.py` file in your preferred code editor.

2. Locate the `Application` class definition.

3. Inside the `__init__` method of the `Application` class, find the line where the `self.restart_button` button is created.

4. Add a command to the `self.restart_button` button, pointing to a new method called `restart_count`. This method will handle the restart functionality.

   ```python
   self.restart_button = tk.Button(self, text="Restart", command=self.restart_count)
   ```

5. Add the `restart_count` method to the `Application` class. This method will reset the number to 0 and update the number label.

   ```python
   def restart_count(self):
       self.number = 0
       self.number_label.config(text=str(self.number))
   ```

6. Save the `main.py` file.

7. Run the application to see the restart button in action.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

Now, when you click the "Restart" button, the number will be reset to 0.
